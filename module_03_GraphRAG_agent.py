# # Module 3 - GraphRAG and Agents
# This module has the following objectives:
#
# * Experiment with queries for an Agent
# * Define Tooling
# * Create agents with the available tools
# * Chatbot for an Agent
# * Text2Cypher (if we have time)

# ## Agent Thinking
'''
Let's say we want to build an Agent with multiple tools. Let's try to provide the following functionality:

### 1. Retrieve the skills of a person
- **Input**: Person
- **Output**: Skills
- **Example**: What skills does Chris Booth have?

### 2. Retrieve similar skills to other skills
- **Input**: Skills  
- **Output**: Skills
- **Example**: What skills are similar to PowerBI and Data Visualization?

### 3. Retrieve similar persons to a person specified
- **Input**: Person
- **Output**: Person  
- **Example**: *"Which persons have similar skills as Chris Booth?"*

### 4. Retrieve Persons based on a set of skills
- **Input**: Skills
- **Output**: Person
- **Example**: Which persons have Python and AWS experience?
